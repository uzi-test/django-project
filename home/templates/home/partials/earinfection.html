        </ul>
        <p>
          The main symptom of earache is pain in and around the ear. Ear pain will in almost every case 
          of earache be the main symptom. Accompanying symptoms will then vary depending on what is 
          causing your earache. Obvious symptoms to look out for include discharge from the ear which 
          is indicative of an infection. This can be a massive sign, especially for young children who 
          won’t be able to spot an infection themselves. If you think your child has earache book an 
          appointment via the new NHS Pharmacy First service.

          <h3 class="fw-bold">Treatment</h3>
          <p>
            We offer various treatment options for earaches, depending on the severity.
            For milder cases, there are simple options like over-the-counter ear drops or
            home remedies, such as using a warm flannel on the affected ear. However,
            for more severe cases, a more complex treatment may be necessary, which could
            include prescription medications, including antibiotics if deemed necessary.
            Our knowledgeable pharmacist will provide a consultation to determine the
            underlying cause of your earache, enabling them to prescribe the suitable
            medication or treatment.

          <h3 class="fw-bold">Causes</h3>
          <p>
            Earache can stem from various reasons, including teething in young children.
            Other factors such as excessive earwax buildup or a foreign object lodged in
            the ear may also contribute to ear pain. Pinpointing the exact cause of
            earache in a child can be challenging. If your child is experiencing
            earache, it is best to consult our pharmacist for proper evaluation.
            In adults, earache is typically not linked to teething and may be a
            symptom of an ear infection. These infections are often caused by bacteria
            and can be excruciatingly painful. Dental problems, such as tooth infections
            or impacted wisdom teeth, may also result in ear pain due to their proximity
            to the ears. In such cases, dental symptoms may also accompany earache.

          <h3 class="fw-bold">Complications</h3>
          <p>
            Earache is not a worrisome condition in itself. Though it can be painful and
            a nuisance, the main worry is complications resulting from unchecked infection.
            Most obviously your hearing could become damaged due to complications from
            earache. Perforated eardrums, ear infections and inflammation can all wreak
            havoc with your hearing. Complications range from tinnitus (ringing noise in
            the ear) to partial or complete deafness, though this is thankfully rare.
            NHS Pharmacy First aims to help prevent these complications by providing a
            more immediate source of support and advice.
