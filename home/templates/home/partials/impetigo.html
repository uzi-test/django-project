            There are several forms of bacterial skin infection, varying in severity.
            One of these is <strong>Impetigo</strong>, a well-known type of infection.  
            It can affect people of any age, but is most frequently seen in children
            and infants. Fortunately, with the help of <strong>NHS Pharmacy First</strong>,
            you can now quickly seek treatment for this condition, avoiding the hassle
            of scheduling a GP appointment.

        <p class="mb-0">
          It's important to note that there are two types of impetigo:
          <strong>'Bullous Impetigo'</strong> which is characterized by blistering,
          and <strong>'Non-Bullous Impetigo'</strong> which does not typically involve blistering.
          While both types have similar symptoms, bullous impetigo can be more severe and painful.
          The main symptom of this type is the presence of large, fragile blisters all over the body.
          Non-bullous impetigo, on the other hand, presents with small, red sores that eventually
          turn into crusts with a honey-like color. In both cases, itching, redness, and discomfort
          are common. The good news is that both types can be effectively treated with antibiotics
          if detected early and proper follow-up care is maintained.

        <div class="bg-white rounded-4 shadow-sm h-100 text-center p-3">

          <h3 class="fw-bold">Who is at risk?</h3>
          <p>
            Impetigo primarily affects young children and infants, but it can occur in individuals of any age.
            This bacterial infection is particularly common in those with a weakened immune system,
            making it difficult to fend off. It is also prevalent in warm and humid climates,
            which create ideal conditions for the bacteria to thrive.
            Other risk factors for impetigo include pre-existing skin issues like eczema, psoriasis,
            or dermatitis, as these compromised skin conditions can make a person more susceptible to the infection.

      <!-- Treatments -->

        <div class="bg-white rounded-4 shadow-sm h-100 text-center p-3">
          <img src="{% static 'images/treatimp.jpg' %}" class="img-fluid rounded-top-4 mb-3">
          <h3 class="fw-bold">Treatments</h3>
          <p>
            Topical antibiotics in the form of creams effectively kill the bacteria causing impetigo,
            preventing infection and limiting its spread. While they also help relieve symptoms like
            itchiness, oral antibiotics are typically reserved for severe or epidemic cases.
            This is because they can attack the bacteria throughout the entire body, not just on the skin's surface.
            Good hygiene practices are also advised to reduce spreading of the disease,
            and over-the-counter pain relievers can help with symptoms.
            Follow-up consultations may be necessary in severe cases where standard treatments
            are not effective, and a referral to a specialist may be required.
            In extreme cases, local populations may be advised to avoid school or work to limit the spread of impetigo,
            but this is rare.

          <img src="{% static 'images/compimp.jpg' %}" class="img-fluid rounded-top-4 mb-3">
          <h3 class="fw-bold">Complications</h3>
          <p>
            Left unchecked impetigo can lead to various serious health complications.
            Although uncommon it's important to understand the potential risks so you can help prevent them from happening.
            For example, cellulitis is an infection of the deeper layers of skin and tissue.
            These complications of impetigo are serious—if you notice any of these,
            you must be referred to a specialist for treatment.

    <!-- Extra Info -->
    <div class="mt-5 text-center px-3 px-md-5">
      <p class="mb-4">
        Impetigo, a highly contagious bacterial infection, can affect people of all ages.
        However, children and young infants are at a higher risk. Thankfully,
        <strong>NHS Pharmacy First</strong> offers a FREE service for diagnosing and treating this and six other
        common health conditions. This service provides GP-level care and treatment without the usual lengthy
        wait times.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        It is important to be able to recognize the symptoms of impetigo, such as red sores, blisters,
        swollen lymph nodes, fever, and itchy skin, in order to receive prompt treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although impetigo is generally mild, it can lead to more serious conditions, such as cellulitis or
        scarlet fever. Individuals with weakened immune systems or existing skin conditions are particularly at
        risk.
