            Shingles is a common condition covered for free by NHS Pharmacy first
            service. It's crucial to have a basic understanding of shingles to seek proper
            treatment. Shingles is a caused by the sae virus that leads to chickenpox.
            However, it only affects those who have had chickenpox before. While shingles
            cannot be passed from person to person, those with shingles can still transmit
            chickenpox to those who have not been vaccinated or had the virus. It's important
            to be cautions, especially around vulnerable individuals. Shingles presents as a
            line of blisters on the chest or face.

          <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Treatment</h3>
          <p>
            Common prescriptions include antivirals, painkillers, topical creams or ointments,
            antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and corticosteroids. Antivirals are effective if
            taken within 72 hours of symptom onset and can reduce the duration of the outbreak.
            Your healthcare provider may still recommend antivirals after this window if they
            believe it will help. Over-the-counter painkillers may also be suggested to alleviate
            discomfort. Topical treatments can provide relief for itching and discomfort directly
            on the rash site. Antidepressants and anticonvulsants, though not typically used,
            may be prescribed for pain management. Corticosteroids, while sometimes used, have
            potential risks and will only be recommended in severe cases. Prioritize consulting
            with your pharmacist or GP if you suspect you have shingles to determine the best
            treatment plan.

          <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Who is at risk?</h3>
          <p>
            Two key risk factors for shingles are age and a weakened immune system. Individuals
            who are over 50 are at a higher risk due to their immune system becoming weaker as
            they age. Additionally, a weakened immune system can also result from certain
            medications, such as corticosteroids or chemotherapy, as well as from autoimmune
            diseases. Reasons for a weakened immune system can vary. It is important to be
            vigilant and recognize the early signs of shingles if you fall into this high-risk
            category, so that you can seek treatment promptly.

          <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Complications</h3>
          <p>
            While most cases of shingles resolve within a few weeks, it can lead to complications.
            Infection of the rashes may require treatment with antibiotics, and scarring can occur
            on the affected skin. If shingles affects the area near your eyes, it could lead to
            vision impairment. In rare cases, it may even result in Ramsay Hunt syndrome,
            weakening facial nerves and potentially impacting hearing. The key to preventing these
            complications is seeking treatment promptly. If you experience any symptoms of
            shingles, you can schedule an appointment with a pharmacist through Pharmacy First or
            with a GP. Early intervention is crucial in minimizing the risk of any serious
            complications.

<!-- ✅ Bottom Summary -->
<section class="py-4" style="background-color:#eaf2ed;">
  <div class="container text-center">
    <p class="mb-0">
      Shingles is a typically mild medical issue characterized by a rash on the body, which
      usually resolves within a few weeks of symptoms appearing. Most often, patients are
      given antiviral drugs to address the underlying cause, and if necessary, pain medication
      to alleviate discomfort. Nevertheless, certain instances of shingles may escalate in
      severity due to a compromised immune system or other contributing factor. In such
      situations, our pharmacist would promptly refer you for an urgent consultation with
      your GP.
