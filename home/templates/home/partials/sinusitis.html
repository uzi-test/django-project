        <!-- ✅ Chronic Sinusitis Note -->
        <p class="mt-3">
          Sinusitis symptoms generally last up to four weeks. Sometimes the symptoms can
          last longer—more than four weeks, even lasting months! This is known as
          <strong>chronic sinusitis</strong>, where the condition does not resolve within
          the usual timeframe. Rarely, sinusitis becomes chronic (long-term), but when it
          does you will be referred to a specialist to treat the condition.

          <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Treatment</h3>
          <p>
            Sinusitis can be treated with various options including over-the-counter
            medication, prescription nasal spray and drops, antibiotics, and surgical
            treatments. Over-the-counter medication, such as antihistamines and
            decongestant nasal sprays, can provide short-term relief, but may not be
            suitable for everyone due to underlying health conditions.  
            It’s essential to consult with a pharmacist before taking any medication.
            Nasal sprays—including antihistamine, decongestant, corticosteroid, and
            saline sprays—can also be used to relieve symptoms. While some are available
            over the counter, others require a prescription. Corticosteroid nasal sprays,
            which reduce swelling and inflammation, are typically prescribed by a doctor,
            but can now be obtained for free through the NHS Pharmacy First service.

          <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Who is at risk?</h3>
          <p>
            Sinusitis poses a greater threat to certain demographics, such as infants,
            young children, and those with respiratory conditions or allergies.
            Children’s less developed immune systems and poor hygiene make them more
            susceptible to bacterial infections. Asthma and allergies, particularly
            to pollen, put individuals at a higher risk. Structural issues in the nose,
            such as narrow passages or nasal polyps, can also increase the likelihood of
            sinusitis. Smoking damages the respiratory system, leaving it vulnerable to
            infections, including sinusitis.  
            If experiencing any symptoms of sinusitis, our pharmacist can quickly address
            them without needing to see a doctor. While this is not an exhaustive list of
            risk factors, it is important to be aware of potential triggers and seek
            treatment promptly.

               class="img-fluid rounded-4 shadow-sm mb-3 card-img-fixed">
          <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Complications</h3>
          <p>
            Sinusitis can lead to various complications, such as cellulitis which is
            characterized by swelling of the cheekbone or eyelid. This can become a
            serious issue and requires immediate treatment. Unfortunately, cellulitis
            cannot be treated by a pharmacist. Patients will be referred to their GP
            or an ENT specialist for treatment.  
            A more severe complication that can arise from sinusitis is the infection
            spreading to nearby bone, although this is rare with only 1 in 10,000 cases.
            Antibiotics are typically prescribed to prevent the spread of infection and
            resolve the issue. It’s important to seek medical attention if you suspect
            any complications from sinusitis to ensure appropriate treatment.

<!-- ✅ Bottom Summary -->

  <div class="container text-center">
    <p class="mb-0">
      Sinusitis is a widespread ailment and while it is typically mild,
      it can potentially result in severe health complications. While these
      complications are infrequent and uncommon, it is crucial to address
      them proactively to avoid long-term health consequences. Maintaining
      proper hygiene can assist in minimizing the risk of developing any
      health issues (this includes preventing bacterial infections altogether).
      It is worth noting that the majority of sinusitis cases will naturally
      resolve without any additional health concerns. However, if you have
      concerns and this is not the case for you, we are prepared to offer
      solutions for this condition.
