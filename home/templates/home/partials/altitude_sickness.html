            Altitude sickness can occur when your body cannot get enough oxygen at high altitudes. Symptoms include headaches, nausea, dizziness, or difficulty breathing. 
            It typically occurs above 8,000 feet if the ascent is rapid. Our team offers consultations and medication tailored to your travel plan.
