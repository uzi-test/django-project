            A urinary tract infection occurs when bacteria enter the urinary system,
            affecting the bladder, urethra, or kidneys. It can cause pain,
            frequent urges to urinate, and discomfort during urination.
            Prompt treatment is important to prevent complications
            and speed recovery.

          UTIs can affect anyone but are more common in women. If left untreated,
          the infection can spread to the kidneys and cause more serious issues.
          Early recognition and treatment are key to a quick recovery.

          <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Causes</h3>
          <p>
            UTIs are common infections of the urinary tract caused by bacteria.
            They usually affect the lower urinary tract near the urethra or bladder.
            Risk factors for UTIs include kidney stones, weakened immune system,
            certain contraceptive methods, diabetes, and the use of catheters.
            Women are at a higher risk due to their shorter urethra and proximity
            to the anus, while men may also be at risk if they have an enlarged prostate.
            UTIs are more common and less serious compared to other types of infections.
            Prevention through hygiene and proper medical care is important in reducing
            the risk of UTIs.

          <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Treatment</h3>
          <p>
            The best course of treatment will be determined based on the individual's
            symptoms and overall health. For recurrent UTIs, vaginal creams may be
            prescribed, while painkillers can help manage symptoms.
            <br><br>
            Please note that Pharmacy First does not cover treatment for women over
            65 years of age. In such cases, a GP should be consulted due to potential
            complications. For those under 65, our pharmacists can provide treatment
            as needed, offering a convenient one-stop-shop option. This can save time
            and eliminate the need to travel to a GP for a prescription.

               class="img-fluid rounded-4 shadow-sm mb-3 card-img-fixed">
          <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Complications</h3>
          <p>
            UTIs can have serious consequences, such as spreading to the kidneys
            or bloodstream. In these cases, seeking medical attention from your GP
            or calling 111 is crucial.
            <br><br>
            UTIs are more common in certain groups, such as diabetics,
            who are at higher risk due to weaker immune systems.
            Women are also more prone to UTIs, partly because of anatomical
            differences with men. Contraceptive methods such as diaphragms
            can increase a woman's chances of developing a UTI.
            <br><br>
            Pregnancy can further increase the risk due to hormonal changes
            and pressure on the urinary tract. Postmenopausal women and
            elderly individuals are also at higher risk due to lower estrogen
            levels and age-related bladder changes.
