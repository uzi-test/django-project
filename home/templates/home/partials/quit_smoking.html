            Quitting smoking is a journey that many people embark on, but not everyone is successful. 
            It's a habit that can be difficult to break, but the benefits of quitting far outweigh the temporary pleasure of lighting up a cigarette.

          <p class="mt-3" style="font-size:1rem; line-height:1.5; max-width:550px;">
           Quitting smoking is not easy, but it is one of the best decisions you may ever make for your health and well-being. It's a journey that requires determination and support, but the benefits are worth it. If you are thinking 
           about quitting smoking, I encourage you to take the first step and seek out support and resources. Your future self will thank you.

          <h5 class="fw-bold text-dark">Improve Mental Health</h5>
          <p class="text-dark" style="font-size:0.95rem;">
            Not only does quitting smoking benefit your physical health, but it also has a positive impact on your mental health. 
            Smoking is often used as a coping mechanism for stress and anxiety, but in reality, it only adds to these issues.

          <p class="text-dark" style="font-size:0.95rem;">
            Another major benefit of quitting smoking is the financial savings. Smoking is an expensive habit, 
            and the cost adds up quickly. It's amazing to see how much money you could be wasting on something that is harming your health.

          Of course, quitting smoking is not an easy feat. It takes determination, willpower, and support. 
          One of the things that helps most is finding a support system. Whether it's through a quit smoking program, online support groups,
           or friends and family, having people who understand what you are going through and can offer encouragement and advice 
           can be crucial in your journey to quit smoking.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #222;">
          It's also important to have a plan in place. Set a quit date and stick to it, and find healthy alternatives to smoking, such as chewing gum or going for a walk when cravings hit. It's also helpful to 
          identify triggers and find ways to avoid or cope with them. For example, if you usually smoke after a meal, try going for a walk instead.
