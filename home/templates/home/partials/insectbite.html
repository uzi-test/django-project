        <p>
          Infected insect bites often resemble non-infected bites, making it
          tricky to tell the difference. Key signs can help you recognise when
          medical attention is needed.

          <p>
            There is no rational link between specific individuals and insect bites.
            The only general rule for anyone worried about getting bitten is to
            cover exposed skin when outdoors. Wearing jeans is particularly effective
            in protecting the legs. If long-sleeved clothing is not possible,
            insect repellent can be applied (especially on hot days!). Follow
            instructions carefully, as some repellents may need to be reapplied
            throughout the day.<br><br>
            For those with fruit-bearing trees, regularly clearing away fallen fruit
            can prevent insects from gathering. Similarly, keeping a reasonable
            distance from flowering plants can decrease the likelihood of insect
            bites. Keep doors and windows closed to keep insects out of homes.
            Lastly, avoid spending extended periods near water as mosquitos and
            horseflies are commonly found in these areas.

               class="img-fluid rounded-4 shadow-sm mb-3">
          <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Treatment</h3>
          <p>
            Treatment options for this condition may vary. Normally, a pharmacist
            may prescribe antihistamines, steroid creams, or painkillers to
            alleviate the discomfort caused by an infected insect bite. These
            treatments address a broad range of symptoms that may be experienced
            due to the bite.<br><br>
            When an insect bite is more severe, oral antibiotics may be prescribed
            by the pharmacist, but only if necessary. In severe cases where the
            patient experiences an allergic reaction, the pharmacist may not be
            able to provide treatment directly, but may instead prescribe an
            adrenaline pen to be used in case of future complications.<br><br>
            In mild cases, or when it is uncertain if the bite is infected, simple
            home remedies can be tried. These include washing the affected area
            with soap and water, using a cold compress, and avoiding scratching the
            area. If these remedies do not provide relief, patients can book an
            appointment with our pharmacist through NHS Pharmacy First.

               class="img-fluid rounded-4 shadow-sm mb-3">
          <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Complications</h3>
          <p>
            Being bitten by an insect can lead to various health complications.
            Lyme disease, caused by an infected tick bite, can result in a
            circular rash around the bite area along with other symptoms such as
            high fever, headache, and fatigue. This can be treated effectively if
            caught early.<br><br>
            Scabies caused by mites can cause intense itching and a raised rash.
            If left untreated, it can lead to more serious health issues like
            sepsis, heart disease, and kidney problems. Treatment usually involves
            prescription creams or oral medication.<br><br>
            Malaria, although not found in the UK, can be fatal if contracted
            through a mosquito bite. Symptoms include high fever, chills,
            confusion, fatigue, and many others, appearing up to 18 days after
            being bitten. In case of suspicion of malaria, urgent medical
            attention should be sought and those who have been traveling should
            also be informed.
