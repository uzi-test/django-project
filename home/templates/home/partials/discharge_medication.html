        <p style="font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.7; color:#222;">
          Our pharmacist looks at all the medicines that you take. You can talk to them about:
        </p>

        <ul style="font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.7; color:#222;">
          <li>Any new medicines that we gave you in hospital</li>
          <li>Any changes that we made to your medicines during your hospital stay</li>
          <li>All of your medicines and how best to take them</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.7; color:#222;">

        <h5 class="fw-bold mt-4" style="color:#004d26;">How this service can help you</h5>

        <p style="font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.7; color:#222;">
          About half of all medicines are not taken as they are prescribed. Common errors include:
        </p>

        <ul style="font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.7; color:#222;">
          <li>Taking the wrong dose (amount)</li>
          <li>Taking the medicine at the wrong time</li>
          <li>Not taking the medicine at all</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.7; color:#222;">
          If you do not take your medicines as prescribed, your condition is not treated correctly and could even get worse.  
          By understanding your medicines and the best way to take them, you can make sure that they help you as much as possible.  
          Our pharmacist will support you to feel confident about managing your medicines at home.  
          This is a free service and our pharmacist works closely with your GP.
